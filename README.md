This application is a simple Grading Log UI based on JavaFX.
It allows to review records, add, update, delete  new subjects, students, and grades for selected students and given subjects. It also allows to calculate average 
grade for a given student-subject. Records are kept in SQLite database.
In order for application to work you need to add two external libraries to the project - Java FX 11 and sqlite JDBC driver, wich are linked below:
